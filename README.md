#NOTICE

I can't keep up with the changes in GTK anymore. As you'll have noticed, this theme still has bugs in GTK 3.8, and remains untested by me in GTK 3.10 and up. If anyone wants to pick this project up, you're very much welcome to do so.

#About

BleuFear is a GTK 2/3 theme with a wild streak of electric blue. It is inspired by the design of my site and everything else that fits that color scheme. The name comes from the French word for blue(duh) and the way Americans pronounce the first part of my last name. (Also, it's a dark theme so fear~=dark).

More about me and other projects I have [here](http://www.maxfierke.com/).

#Install

-   Copy to /usr/share/themes/ and select it in which ever way you normally do.

or

-   Run ./deploy.sh (Does the same thing as above, just automagically)

##Ubuntu Users
You're fancy and can install it via my PPA
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:m4xm4n/bleufear && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bleufear-theme
</pre>

##ArchLinux Users

You too are fancy and can take advantage of my [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=55505).
